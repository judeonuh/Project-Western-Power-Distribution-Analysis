# Western Power Distribution Analysis
___  

## Description
___
This is a simple analysis of import fixed charges and Year-on-Year percentage change of a Power Distribution Company. Data spans a period of 5 financial years (i.e 2020 - 2024). Note: A financial year runs from 1st April to 31st March (eg. 1st April 2020 - 31st March 2021). By analysing the data across networks with respect to customer bands, this project extracts annual sales records for a Power Company, facilitating decision-making processes. 

## Aim and Objectives
___
This analysis provides insight into power consumption patterns and revenue generation. This will be achieved by:
- Calculating Annual Import Fixed Charges (AFC) for all customers from their Import Fixed Charges (IFC).
- Analysing customer distribution (with respect to their Residual Charging Band) across all four (4) regions studied.
- Calculating Year-on-Year percentage change for each customer
